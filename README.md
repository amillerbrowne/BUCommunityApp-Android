This app uses the Google Maps API to visualize the locations of buildings in and affiliated with Boston University (BU). In short, it's a BU map, a map of one of the largest research universities in Massachusetts: Boston University. Currently, it maps out the Charles River Campus, and it will eventually also display the Medical Campus. 

You find your way around the map by tapping buildings on the map, and the app tells you which building you have selected by displaying it in blue.

If you're a student that needs to know where to go, you can type in the acronym for your building to determine the right directions to your building.

This app is made by Boston University students from the volunteer organization Global App Initiative and has no official affiliation to Boston University.
